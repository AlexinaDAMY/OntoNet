To create an ontology on OntoNet editable with WebProtege:

0- [OPTIONAL: if the project needs to be created from an OBO file]
Use the OBO cleaning function in OntoNet, generating a new file.

1- Log in to WebProtege and create a new project by selecting the file from which to create the project.
If step 0 has been completed, select the OBO file generated after correction. If the file cannot be read, create a test project in OntoNet with the file to see what is preventing it from being read.

2- Download the ontology file from WebProtege in 'OWL Functional Syntax' format. Unzip the downloaded file (named "urn_webprotege_ontology_[...].ofn").

3- Create a new project in OntoNet: select 'Import WebProtege file: ofn format' and select the unzipped file from WebProtege.

4- Enter the project-related information.
